We have a non-neural joint lemmatizer and tagger using Lemming. There are also two separate neural models: one for lemmatizing and one for tagging.

Specific instructions for each are in their corresponding folders.

Scores for the neural models are [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hqbhe5CSqx0evq15Y0q481MiYB25gZgpsW1pxmA2s6k/edit?usp=sharing).

**Note:** Remember to download submodules with `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
